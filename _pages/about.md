Hello everyone!! 
I am Srutee Rout, Prime Minister Research Fellow (PMRF) (Dec 2021- Till date) in the Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, working under Professor Prem Prakash Srivastav. My research mainly focuses on non-thermal processing technology such as Cold Plasma and Plant based meat products. I have joined the Ph.D. program at IIT Kharagpur in December 2020 as an Institute Fellow which was later converted to PMRF by lateral entry.

I have completed my M.Tech degree in Food Biotechnology from Institute of Chemical Technology, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India in 2020. Prior to that, I received my B.Tech degree in Biotechnology from College of Engineering and Technology (now OUTR), Bhubaneswar, Odisha in 2018 under Biju Patnaik University of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India.
